Stores data as local storage, imports and exports txt files. Made for keyboard-intensive usage (see below).

Tested in newest Chrome only. Firefox should work, too. I don't care about Safari.

## Demo

**Try out the editor here: https://screenwriter.zeitpulse.com/**.

The data is stored in your browsers local storage.

## Keyboard Usage

 * `tab`: change the type of text in the current secion (text, charater for dialog, dialog text and annotation)
 * `shift` + `enter`: insert a new line in the current section
 * `meta`+`backspace`: remove the current section
 * `meta`+`enter`: insert a new section
 * `shift`+`arrow-down`: merge this section with next one

## Features

To detect the beginning of a new scene, you should start the line with `INT.` or `EXT.`.

The editor will suggest the next name of the character if you are in a dialog.

Other features:

 * exports screenplay as plain-text or json
 * imports screenplay from plain-text (using the same spacing-conventions) or json
 * auto-saves/downloads screenplay to local file every minute (beware, there is no real undo implemented - if a section is deleted, it's gone)
 * cover page for printing
 * editing meta data
 * focus mode (inspired by iaWriter)
 * enjoy dark-mode

## TODOs

 * faster cleanup of html/plain-text during text changes
 * make spaces configurable in interface (via metaData)
 * consider word wrap in import
 * more undo
