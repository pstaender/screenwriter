                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA

A pale, dead-flat lunar landscape. It gets brighter, lit 
from above, as MIR ONE enters FRAME and drops to the seafloor 
in a downblast from its thrusters. It hits bottom after its 
two hour free-fall with a loud BONK.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. MIR ONE

Lovett and Bodine jerk awake at the landing.

                      ANATOLY
               (heavy Russian accent)
          We are here.

EXT. / INT. MIR ONE AND TWO

MINUTES LATER: THE TWO SUBS

Skim over the seafloor to the sound of sidescan sonar and 
the THRUM of big thrusters.

The featureless gray clay of the bottom unrolls in the lights 
of the subs. Bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, 
where the outline of a huge pointed object is visible. Anatoly 
lies prone, driving the sub, his face pressed to the center 
port.

                      BODINE
          Come left a little. She's right in 
          front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen. 
          Thirteen... you should see it.

                      ANATOLY
          Do you see it? I don't see it... 
          there!

Out of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of 
the ship appears. Its knife-edge prow is coming straight at 
us, seeming to plow the bottom sediment like ocean waves. It 
towers above the seafloor, standing just as it landed 84 
years ago.

THE TITANIC

Or what is left of her. Mir One goes up and over the bow 
railing, intact except for an overgrowth of "rusticles" 
draping it like mutated Spanish moss.

TIGHT ON THE EYEPIECE MONITOR of a video camcorder. Brock 
Lovett's face fills the BLACK AND WHITE FRAME.

                                                   FADE OUT:

                          THE END
