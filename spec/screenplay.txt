                     JOHN
          Well, one can't have everything.


                                               CUT TO:

EXT. JOHN AND MARY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


MIKE steps out of the car and walks up to the front door.
He rings the doorbell.


                                             BACK TO:

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS


                     JOHN
          Who on Earth could that be?


                     MARY
          I'll go and see.


Mary gets up and walks out. The front door lock CLICKS and
door CREAKS a little as it's opened.


                     MARY
          Well hello Mike! Come on in!
          John, Mike's here!


                     JOHN
          Hiya Mike! What brings you here?
